This is the wesbite that I found that details how to set up an arduino to play sound: it is very straightfoward and should be the least of our worries.

Essentially plug the two wires of the speaker into the designated pins of the arduino board and run the code. simple as that, we can 
potentially consider playing a set of tones or even a song (roar lions roar) for kicks and giggles.
